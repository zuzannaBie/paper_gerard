# Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa.

Particle size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004).

Jones et al (1998) conducted several studies in this region,
but continental-scale measurements have not previously been made.

# Simulations
We simulate the evolution of the particle sizes as they are
transported from the source region.

# Methodology
We compared our measurements of particle aging with a model simulation.
The model is detailed in Smith et al 2002.
